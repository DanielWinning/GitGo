# GitGo

Stage, commit and push all in one command! Ever find yourself having to type the same three commands over and over again?

```
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

Nope? Well I do, so I made this to speed up my workflow a bit and because it was fun :)

### Pre-requisites

**PHP 7.0+** is required to be included in your `$PATH`.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract the archive to a convenient location on your machine.
3. Add the `bin` directory to your `$PATH` environment variable.
4. Run `gg` to check it is working.

### Usage

```
gg "<message>"
```

That's it :)
